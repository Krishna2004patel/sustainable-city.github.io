  This Sustainable City Coding Project focuses on leveraging technology to design
  and simulate solutions for creating environmentally friendly, efficient, and livable
  urban environments. This project involves developing strategies that address
  critical challenges like energy efficiency, waste management, transportation, green
  building design, water conservation, and urban planning. By incorporating real-time
  data analysis, IoT integration, and predictive modeling, the project aims to enhance
  resource optimization, reduce carbon footprints, and improve the overall quality
  of life for urban populations while promoting long-term environmental sustainability.
